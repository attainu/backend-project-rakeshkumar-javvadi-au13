## Benefits of Project

```

➢ This project really helped in understanding the underlying concepts of backend environment very deeply.

➢ Node.js is really a fantastic language, with all its inbuilt libraries and npm package support, it becomes even more powerful.

➢ Concepts related to Authentication, securing password, defining user roles (authorisation) and saving data securely to database
   are crystal clear after getting my hands dirty on this project. 
   
➢ Although it is a backend project, yet the user interface made me learn many front end topics as well, 
   I feel empowered with the front end tools and concepts too.
   
➢ It was really a very great experience 
   for me and I have put my heart and soul to make this project live just in time.

```

## Future Scope

```
➢  There is always some room for improvement, we add SEARCH option to seach city wise
➢ list of school or directly search school name.

➢ And add some addition feature directly in the admin page .

➢ And User can apply directly from our app and make fees payment etc to the school  .

➢ O-auth like Google auth or Facebook auth can be implemented.

➢ For the above-mentioned point,  a safe and secure payment gateway can be 
implemented as well.
